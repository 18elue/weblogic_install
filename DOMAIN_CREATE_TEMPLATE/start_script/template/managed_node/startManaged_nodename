# This script is used to start a managed WebLogic Server for the domain in
# the current working directory.  This script can either read in the SERVER_NAME and
# ADMIN_URL as positional parameters or will read them from environment variables that are 
# set before calling this script. If SERVER_NAME is not sent as a parameter or exists with a value
# as an environment variable the script will EXIT. If the ADMIN_URL value cannot be determined
# by reading a parameter or from the environment a default value will be used.
# 
#  For additional information, refer to the WebLogic Server Administration 
# Guide (http://e-docs.bea.com/wls/docs92/adminguide)
